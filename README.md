# Exploring-BI-Tools
### A Visualization Project on Exploring different Open Source BI Tools namely Apache Superset and Metabase.
## End-to-End Project Idea:
Building two fully **functional dashboards** created using the same dataset  — one using **Apache Superset** and the other using **Metabase**. The dashboards should showcase a range of **visualizations, filters**, and interactions.

Making a comprehensive comparison report detailing on the following:
   - Core features of both tools.
   
   - **Flexibility**, ease of use, and performance while creating dashboards.
  
   - Pros and cons of Apache Superset and Metabase.
   
   - Insights on their advanced capabilities (**scheduling, data filtering, access control**, etc.). (Optional, Exploratory). 
   
   - **Time Series** and **Trend Analysis**
